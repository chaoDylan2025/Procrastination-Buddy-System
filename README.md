# Procrastination-Buddy-System

## What is the Procrastionation Buddy-System
A web application whose goal is to assist users with improving their focus and reduce how often users procrastinate on their work.

In order to use the application, the user will need to create an account. Once an account has been created, the user will be able to have their own personal motivational page, tasks list, and focus list.

A personal motivational page will be different for each user, and contains all of the images that a user stores. The user can choose to upload more or delete some images.

A focus list contains a website or several websites that a user does not want to vist when signed in. To ensure that the user does not visit those restricted websites, a Google Chrome extension will be installed which will be connected to the web application.

If a user were to visit one of their restricted websites, they will be redirected to an image of the user's choice that gets them back to focusing on their work.
